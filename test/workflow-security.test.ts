// A workflow is executable code holding this repo's token. This file is the
// security gate on that surface.
//
// SUPPLY CHAIN — a `uses:` ref pinned to a moving tag (`@v5`) or a branch
// (`@main`) lets whoever controls that upstream ref run arbitrary code in this
// repo's CI. A full 40-hex commit SHA cannot be repointed, so the code we
// audited is the code that runs. Pinning is also TRANSITIVE: a pinned caller
// whose callee resolves a mutable ref at run time is not pinned at all, which
// is why first-party refs get no exemption here either.
//
// TOKEN SCOPE — a workflow with no top-level `permissions:` block inherits the
// repository default, which may be read-WRITE. Declaring a read-only scope at
// the top means a compromised step cannot push code or cut a release.
//
// This repo's ci.yml shipped with three unpinned actions (`actions/checkout@v5`,
// `pnpm/action-setup@v6`, `actions/setup-node@v5`) and nothing that could notice.
// Each rule below is paired with its own accept/reject cases so the rule itself
// is proven, not assumed.
